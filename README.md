ðŸ‘‰ AI Mental Health Diagnosis System

A machine learning project that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to help diagnose potential mental health conditions based on user responses and symptoms.

ðŸ‘‰ Project Overview

This AI-based project is designed to assist in the early identification of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and more. Using behavioral data like sleep quality, stress levels, mood scores, and physical activity, the system trains a Decision Tree Classifier to predict a likely diagnosis. It leverages scikit-learn for machine learning and integrates pyttsx3 for voice interaction, creating a conversational and supportive experience. Users answer guided questions, and the model provides predictions along with helpful wellness suggestions. This tool is not a replacement for professional help but serves as a smart companion for mental well-being awareness.
